# Read in data
# Note that in the Angrist paper/data constructs two datasets both using Census 1980 5% PUMS data: one for all women with two or more children (n = 394840); the other for all *married* women with two or more children (n = 254652). However, in the Athey paper, it studys "a sample of n = 334535 married mothers with at least 2 children (1980 census data)". **I cannot find ways to come up with n = 334535**
